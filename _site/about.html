<p>For virtually my entire life I have known that I have wanted to be a teacher, but not until my junior year at BATESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL did I know I wanted to teach mathematics. I had an absolutely wonderful precalculus teacher who showed me the beauty of math with her powerful, logical, consistent, and elegant teaching style – qualities I hadn’t yet seen in a math instructor.</p>

<p>I was admitted to PURDUE UNIVERSITY as a student in mathematics education, but after considering that teachers don’t make a lot of money – and that actuaries do – I decided to change my major to actuarial science. This is what I studied during my first year; however, about three weeks into my second semester, completing work for a financial mathematics course (that overall I loved), something was telling me that actuarial science wasn’t for me. I found that I enjoyed helping people with mathematics much more than I enjoyed doing calculations. I daydreamed of becoming a teacher. It was then that I decided to declare majors (again) in mathematics and mathematics education. My last involvement with (learning) actuarial science occurred in June 2016, when I sat for (and ultimately failed) the Society of Actuaries Exam FM.</p>

<p>I began my studies of pure mathematics and mathematics education during my sophomore year, and thoroughly enjoyed what I was learning. That year, I took part in two “field experiences” in mathematics classrooms – one in a seventh-grade math classroom at LAFAYETTE-TECUMSEH JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, and one in a high school math classroom at WEST LAFAYETTE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL. Those experiences were great, but still something didn’t feel right about them. I was quickly coming to realize that teaching secondary-level math may not have been for me; additionally, I was forming a deep love for the theoretical math I was learning as an undergraduate and wanted to continue to learn about it. Once I came to terms with these two thoughts, I realized what I wanted to do: I wanted to go to graduate school in the hopes to become a professor of mathematics.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of my junior year of undergrad, I have been learning and teaching mathematics at Purdue. I graduated with a bachelor of science in mathematics in December 2018, and a month after that I began my graduate studies in mathematics at Purdue. I am currently pursuing a master of science in mathematics, and hope one day to pursue a Ph.D. in the same. I don’t know too much about what I want to research in mathematics – only that I (very much) prefer algebra to analysis. Who knows where this wild ride called life will take me?</p>

<p>Other than learning and teaching math, I enjoy overall academics, exercising, music (listening mainly to ’60s and ’70s music and playing the guitar and the ukulele), and spending time with friends. I am an avid APPLE fan (regardless of what the haters say, its products get the job done), and I am a self-admitted coffee addict.</p>
